Acknowledging the market‘s need for more standardization in order to grow and mature, the International Token Standardization Association (ITSA) pursues the goal of developing and implementing holistic market standards for the identification (1), classification (2), and in consequence analysis (3) of all distributed ledger (DL) based cryptographic tokens. In the forthcoming of this article we focus on (1) and outline the motivation for and concept underpinning of the International Token Identification Number (ITIN).

Unique identifiers for commodities, products, or assets, have been used on international markets for a long time. For example, currencies are identified through internationally recognized ISO currency codes (e.g. EUR for Euro), andr financial securities and instruments are identified by means of the International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) or the Financial Instrument Global Identifier (FIGI) . The need for a new approach on the identification of tokens arises from the fact that these digital representations of the referenced asset are defined by software on a DL-Protocol that serves as shared infrastructure. This software, let’s refer to it as the token contract, then not only captures details of the token such as the current holdings by participants but also offers logic e.g. to transfer tokens from one participant to another. This is fundamentally different from traditional market infrastructure where securities are administered by central agents which record current holdings as well as transfers in their proprietary systems.

The implications for appropriate identification are obvious: In the latter case, a unique identification code or name, respectively, is sufficient in order to administer and update securities holdings by participants through the central agents in their proprietary systems. On the other hand, for software-defined tokens it is of utmost importance to unambiguously locate the respective token address across DL-Protocol in order for the participants to make sure that a token considered for sale or purchase indeed references the intended asset. This is similar to the problem of locating resources, like a website, in the world wide web (WWW) for which the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) has been created.

Hence, ITSA has developed the ITIN as a unique identifier that is conceptually similar to the URL and serves as an unambiguous means of locating cryptographic tokens across DL protocols and in a fork-resilient manner. Thereby, the ITIN can be used for identification of all DL-based cryptographic tokens, regardless of their economic features such as status as security, their fungibility or tradability.
