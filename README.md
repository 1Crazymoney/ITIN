ITSA aims at promoting the development and implementation of comprehensive market standards for blockchain- and DLT-based cryptographic tokens. To increase transparency and safety on global token markets, ITSA e.V. has developed and implemented the International Token Identification Number (ITIN), a unique and fork-resilient token identifier, the International Token Classification Framework (ITC), a comprehensive classification framework for tokens, and maintains the TOKENBASE, the worldâ€™s largest register for token data.

This repository serves as the official database for the development and publishing of the ITIN.
